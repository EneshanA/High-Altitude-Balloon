# High Altitude Balloon

In my summer internship at Bergen Community College, 
we built a High Altitude balloon that carried payload. We put raspberry pie and connected
sensors that calculates acceleration, air pressure, gps tracker, temperature
and a camera. We built these programs in this folder to write data to CSV files.

Balloon reached out to 96.000 feet altitude and managed to capture spectacular view of Earth 
with various, very useful data.
